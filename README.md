# Medical-Diagnosis
Diagnosing medical conditions given symptoms with academic research reports and live FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Data to bridge real-life data with scientific knowledge; this leverages AI's ability to draw insights from both structured and unstructured data.

There are 28 research reports are uploaded in the file folder (primarily sourced from JSTOR and Google Scholar). The Medical_Diagnosis_FAERS.ipynb file takes the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System's data from Q1 2025 and filters a list of unique drugs across each report and sums the occurrences of reactions/side effects for each drug. This acts as a proxy of seeing how commonly associated a symptom may be with a drug.

Medical_Diagnosis_Academic_Research_Reports.ipynb provides an interface for uploading pdf files (can upload other reports as well) as a source of unstructured data. First we combine the contents of the pdfs into one continuous text string, split them into pieces ("chunks"), and call upon an LLM to summarize the content of each segment. Then we use OpenAI's embedding model ada to embed these into vectors. Finally we construct a user interface for querying an individual's symptoms that they're experiencing alongside any other known taken medications - then conduct semantic search over the content to see if any potential diagnoses of the medical condition causing the user's symptoms.
